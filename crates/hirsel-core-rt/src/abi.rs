//! Native memory ABI, FORM v1. Every symbol and failure convention lives here.
//!
//! `alloc` and `limit_enter` return null plus Capacity on refusal; on success
//! `capacity` is zero. Allocation inside a finalizer must branch to the emitter's
//! Capacity failure path on null. `free`, limit exit and mechanical release never
//! fail. `alloc like` follows the original payer except within finalizers.
//!
//! Contexts are task-owned. Allocation pointers, sizes, alignment and remaining
//! logical charges are trusted emitter operands. None may be stale. Provider
//! operations serialize Arc operations and cross-task refunds in event order.
