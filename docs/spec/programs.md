### PROG-1: Packages

A **package** has a name and a major version and consists of modules; each source file is
one module, with the module path its package manifest assigns. A definition's identity is
its package, version, module path and name. Two versions of a package are two packages,
and their types are distinct. A package names each dependency at one exact version; the
manifest format is outside the language. A package states the charge policy it was
written for ([MEM-24](budgets.md#mem-24-logical-charges)); in v1 that is `charge-v1`.

### PROG-2: Visibility

A definition is private to its module unless marked `pub`. A `pub` type exposes its
fields, variants and constructors, and may be wholly destructured anywhere it is visible,
except that a resource is destructured only in its defining module
([OWN-14](ownership.md#own-14-no-partial-moves)). A `pub opaque` type exposes its name and its published summary
([OWN-2](ownership.md#own-2-type-summaries)) only: outside its module its values cannot be
constructed, destructured, matched on their fields or read field by field. Opaque types
are how a library keeps an invariant ([MEM-18](memory.md#mem-18-pools-are-library-code)).

```hirsel
pub opaque type Month { n: u8 }
pub fn month(n: u8) -> Option[Month] { if n >= 1 && n <= 12 { Some(Month(n: n)) } else { None } }
```
```hirsel
fn forge() -> Unique { Unique(n: 1) }                     // refused: PROG-2, Unique is opaque
```

### PROG-3: Entry

A program's entry is a `pub fn main` named by its manifest. Its parameters are capability
types ([CAP-4](capabilities.md#cap-4-entry-grants)) and `Args`, all unmarked. `Args` is an
opaque plain type designating the run's argument strings, which are host memory outside
every limit and live for the whole run ([core](core.md#built-in-types)), read with
`args.len(a)` and `args.get(a, i) -> Option[View[String]] in a`. Its result is `Result[(), E]` for any `E`. The
run's configuration supplies the root limit ([MEM-19](budgets.md#mem-19-limits)). The run
ends when `main` returns and its cleanup is done: `Ok(())` is success, `Error(e)` is an
error outcome carrying `e`, a failure is a failure outcome
([FAIL-14](failure.md#fail-14-failure-boundary)).

```hirsel
pub fn main(out: Stdout, argv: Args) -> Result[(), WriteError] waits { stdout.write(out, "hello\n") }
```
```hirsel
pub fn main(take xs: List[u64]) -> Result[(), ()] { Ok(()) }   // refused: PROG-3
```

### PROG-4: Tests

A function marked `@test` takes no parameters other than capabilities, and returns
`Result[(), E]`. Each test runs as its own run with its own root limit; `Error` and a
failure fail the test. A test function can be named, called or taken as a value only by
another test function.

```hirsel
@test
fn adds() -> Result[(), ()] { if 1u64 + 1 == 2 { Ok(()) } else { fail("arithmetic") } }
```

### PROG-5: Code identity

Each top-level function has a **code identity**: its definition identity (PROG-1) and its
signature. A call through a function value keeps the callee's identity; a closure has
none of its own. An instance of a generic function is identified by its definition, its
closed type arguments and the dictionaries chosen for its bounds; sizes are not part of
it. Programs cannot read code identities in v1 ([reserved](reserved.md), R13). No
construct dispatches on a function's name or signature at run time, and nothing
observable depends on a function's address or on the order of declarations
([SEM-8](semantics.md#sem-8-determinism)), so two bodies with the same checked meaning
are interchangeable.

### PROG-6: One meaning

A program has one meaning. Whether it is accepted, and what each accepted program does,
does not depend on the engine, the build mode, optimisation, flags, the host, or the order
in which definitions are checked. There are no conditional compilation forms and no
language switches. The one exception is an implementation's resource refusal: a program
whose checking exceeds the implementation's resources (for example unbounded generic
instantiation, or instantiation past a depth or count) may be refused with a message that
names no rule; such a refusal is not a meaning of the program.
